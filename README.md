# HabitsforHabitats
A website (hopefully an app some day) that gives you sustainable options for a given event/task. This is a rough version; my group's submission for Technica 2019.

After adding a task or event, and before you leave the how to complete them, tap the "Leaving House" button to remind you of your sustainable options before you leave. For example, headed to the grocery store? Don't forget those reusable bags! Not too far to walk? Go ahead and enjoy the fresh air:)

It's hard to create habits; on average it's said to take at least two months to form one. So let this website help you out. Hopefully to be completed in the future.
